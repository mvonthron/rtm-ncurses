RtmAPI
======

This is an API package for
`Remember the Milk <http://www.rememberthemilk.com>`_. Using their
API and this package you can create Python applications accessing
your task lists on RTM.

See the example script (in the ``examples`` folder) for basic
usage. You should have read the essential API docs on their website
before.

RtmAPI details
--------------

It's important that you understand the example script to understand
how to use *RtmAPI*. It shows desktop authorization and a basic
list operation.

Authentication
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

See
http://www.rememberthemilk.com/services/api/authentication.rtm.

User authentication for desktop applications can be done using the
``authenticate_desktop`` and ``retrieve_token`` methods, whereas
web applications should use the ``authenticate_web`` and
``retrieve_token`` methods.

API call return values
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you call an API method, it returns the XML wrapped in special
objects. Those object should make it easy to use the API:

Each object has a ``value`` property which returns the XML text.
All other values return either the contents of the XML attribute
with the same name if that exists, or an (again wrapped) child
element with the name.

Some API methods return multiple child elements of the same kind,
ie. XML children with the same tag. Those lists are handled in
*RtmAPI*, ie. you can iterate over those child elements easily. The
example script show the usage of ``rtm.tasks.getList``. Compare the
example script with the ``rtm.tasks.getList`` documentation to
understand how lists work.
